## Stay consistent. Show your growth. Get noticed.

Post **1–2 times per month** to share what you’re learning, building, or reflecting on.
You’re building your **digital footprint** for future job opportunities. _Once you get into a consistent sharing schedule, you can then adjust to add more._

_PS: Don’t forget to interact with posts you find interesting!_

## Post ideas to inspire you

### Learning in progress

Share what you’re currently learning or struggling with.

> "This week I learned..."

Example:
> "This week, I tackled JavaScript functions and finally understood callbacks! Still tricky, but making progress 💪"

### Project or portfolio update

Show something you built or improved, and what you learned.

"I built/improved..."

Example:
> "Just finished my first portfolio site using HTML/CSS. Excited to keep adding more projects!"

### Community shoutout

Celebrate your peers, mentors, or experience in the academy.

"Thanks to..." or "Loving this journey with..."

Example:
> "Grateful for the support from my [academy name] crew — especially during group project week!"

### Tech career reflection / networking

Share a takeaway from a conversation, a meetup, or a goal you’re working toward.

"Had a convo with…" or “Thinking about…”

Example:

> "Had a great chat with a new connection \[maybe even tag them if they don’t mind\] about their first job in tech. Starting to build confidence that I can do this too\!"
