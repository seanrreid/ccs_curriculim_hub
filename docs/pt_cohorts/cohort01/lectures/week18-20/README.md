:::

This is an opportunity to NOT just copy/paste someone else's work, or follow along repeating what I say.

It's an opportunity to make YOUR mark. Write YOUR project, slay YOUR dragons.

Make your project the best expression of YOU, not just a shadow of something else.

> “There was something heavy in me. … I wasn’t doing the right thing. I was just trying to copy exactly everything I had learned. And I think that happens in every craft in life. You’re young. You have a master. You want to emulate them, do what they do. **But at some point in life, you have to turn around and say I have to find my own way in my own language.**”

— Chef Francis Mallmann (emphasis added)

> "Life is not just about peaks and valleys, about wins and losses. Life is about the journey. You hear that all the time. You’ve got to absorb that. You’ve got to know that. The journey has to become the destination because there is no true destination. There is no endpoint. There is no goal. All rivers run to the sea and yet the sea is not full. Life goes on; accept what life gives you. The sun rises the morning after you win the championship or lose in the first round."

— Paul Assaiante, _Run to the Roar_ [Amazon link for those interested in the book](https://www.amazon.com/Run-Roar-Coaching-Overcome-Fear/dp/1591844711)

- [Pages Collective](https://pagecollective.com/) has some great inspiration for page types and layout.
- [Checklist.Design: Pages Checlists](https://www.checklist.design/pages-checklists)
  <br/>
  > There's no one way to design a website. It depends on your goal, audience, and what's on offer.
  > The checklists [on this page] cover a number of pages that can be on a website, so take a look and use whatever's needed for your project.

### PSQL/Supabase

  <br/>NOTE: This tutorial uses `apt` to install `pipenv`, that's a Linux based installer (it's like `brew` on a Mac).
  <br/>Those steps won't work on a Macbook or Windows machine.

- :movie_camera: [Test Driven Development in React](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXXnezSEtvNMlfJFd1Z2wilxymcOaVl9Q) is a 9 video series that discusses the topic of Test Driven Development (TDD). I don't require this for projects, _BUT_, it's something you should get familiar with ASAP.
  <br/>
  If/when you need a break, give one of these videos a watch, each one runs about an hour.
