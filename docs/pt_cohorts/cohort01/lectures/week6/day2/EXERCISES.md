## Get Creative!

We've been using the Magic 8 Ball as our reference. But, not the _only_ fortune teller out there.

Get creative, what other kind of fortune teller interface can you come up wiht?

Examples:

- Zoltar (like from [the movie _Big_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6RK4479XD8))
- Tarot Cards
- [The Three Witches from _Macbeth_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Witches)
