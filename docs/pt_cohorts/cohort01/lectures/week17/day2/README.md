### Web Application Development Graduation Celebration

## Shrink Ray

Let's have our user's _actually_ be able to login.

## Where we've been...

- Code Review
  - What worked?
  - Where are you stuck?
- Check our Models
- Verify migrations
- Test our API to add/update URLs via Swagger
- Add users/tokens models
- Add in JWT and Authentication

## ...where we are going

- Protect `POST` requests
  - Protect `GET` requests as well? Or allow "read only?"
- Add some users and data
- Build forms to login/register
- Update form to submit a new URL
- (Time Permitting) Handle the _actual_ redirection!

We'll reference the [API/UI Updates](./API_UI_UPDATES.md) doc for this round of changes
