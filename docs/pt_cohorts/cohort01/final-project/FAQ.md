## Final Project FAQ

- How do we do check-ins for class?
  - You will be expected to check in with a "standup" report Monday through Friday, between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM.
  - You will answer 3 questions
    1. What did you do yesterday?
    2. What will you do today?
    3. What, if anything, is blocking your progress?
- What support is available during projects?
  - Office Hours will be from 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM every day.
  - In addition to your standup report, this is an opportunity to work with your instructor to resolve any blockers
  - Other times can be scheduled as needed throughout the three project weeks.
  - The [#codehelp channel](https://buildcarolina.slack.com/archives/CM857C3K7) in Slack is also helpful for reaching help from others staff and/or alumni.
  - **NOTE**: If you use [#codehelp](https://buildcarolina.slack.com/archives/CM857C3K7), make sure you explain what you're working on and share a link to your Github repo!
- How often will lectures happen, and will they be optional?
  - There is no set lecture schedule during final projects. Instructional staff (including TAs) may hold impromptu lectures to fill in gaps when multiple students are struggling with the same topic.
  - There _will_ be career support meetings/presentations (more details below) during the usual lecture time.
  - **We strongly suggest attending any lecture/guest speaker opportunities during this time.**
- How often do we check in with the instructor?
  - You must check in with your instructor and/or campus coordinator _every day_ during standup.
  - There will be a final "Demo Day Ready" check-in ~2 days before Demo Day.
    <br/> i.e. If Demo Day is on Friday, this means your project is **feature complete by Wednesday.**
  - Be prepared to show a functioning version of your project to the instructional team at this time.
- (**EDIT 08/01/2025**) Career Support
  - With the creation of the part time course, Career Support has changed.
  - During the final project weeks there will be a variety of career support topics discussed during the usual lecture time.
  - The dates/topics are listed on the the shared calendar, as well as at the top of the [Final Project Guidelines](/docs/pt_cohorts/cohort01/final-project/#career-support-schedule)
