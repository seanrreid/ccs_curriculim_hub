## Résumé Goals

The ultimate goal is to make sure that everything you include on your résumé is 100% relevant and helpful to getting you an interview that will get you the job you want, whether it’s highlighting your coding projects or sharing your transferrable skills from previous work experience.

In general, think about what skills are transferable to your new career like time management, problem-solving, and organization, and then highlight those few things and make them really dynamic.
Here’s a more in-depth workshop put on by TechStack’d and Google that goes over tons of information about what Google recruiters look for when they are hiring for technical roles. It’s long, but a really nice overview. Check it out here: [Tech Stack'd Resume Workshop Video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KREdnXi0_znr9O2V4ilCKoc_qznLzrw9)

## Commandments of Résumé Crafting

- Honesty and Accuracy - Be a good person. You have great things to offer employers without distorting the truth.
- Consistency - In format and in content. Attention to detail is important.
- Relevancy - All content must be laser-focused. Make sure that everything you mention is tailored to whatever position you’re applying for. If you’re applying for project manager roles, as well as developer roles, it’s best to create two separate résumés to highlight the two different skill sets those positions require.
- Conciseness - You have 10 seconds to impress, don’t be redundant. This keeps your content relevant and interesting and allows you to fit more information on your resume.
- Engaging content - No boring, blasé wording here.

As you create your first rough draft, write in everything you can think of skills and experience-wise. This will kickstart your brain to comb through past experiences looking for things to highlight that you may have missed. Even though you will fine-tune your experience and skills information later, it’s easier to start with a lot of content and work your way down.

After you’ve spent significant time writing and editing your résumé, it’s hard to look at it with discerning eyes. This is why it’s always a good idea to get 1 or 2 people to review your résumé before you submit it to an employer. Ideally, try to find someone with either a technical background, professional writing experience, or someone with hiring experience.

You’ve got this!

## Formatting Tips

### Font

Do use a sans serif font (e.g., Verdana, Tahoma) and avoid using serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman). Sans serif fonts have a slightly increased readability compared to serif fonts.
You may also want to play with the size of your font. Generally, font size 10 is a good choice for the majority of the document. However, you may want to use a slightly larger font for your name, contact information, and section headings.

### One page vs. Two

The general rule of thumb is to try to keep your resume to 1 page. However, the ultimate goal is to highlight skills relevant to the job you want and to remove anything extra. If your relevant experience runs over onto a second page, be sure to include it!

Keep in mind that relevant skills do not only encompass your technical abilities. Be sure to include professional skills that you have gained through non-technical experiences (i.e. leadership, time management, communication). This is especially important for career changers.

### Margins

Feel free to play with the margins of the page to help you get to one page. Just make sure the margins are not too narrow. If you get stuck on this, don’t worry! We can help you figure out whether you need one or two pages based on your total content and formatting.

### Headings

A heading is an introduction to each section of your résumé. For example, you will likely want to include: Education, Experience, Skills, etc. Use headings to help readers easily find what they’re looking for, and feel free to use colors to make them “pop.” Just be sure to stick with darker colors to be sure your headings are visible to all.

### A note about consistency...

Regardless of the format you choose, be as consistent as possible. Small inconsistencies can make a résumé look messy and will not convey attention to detail. For example, pay close attention to things like extra spaces between words, sentences without subjects, and using past and present tense appropriately. For example, all previous experiences should use the past tense. If you are currently employed, you should use the present tense when describing what you do in your current position. You can use the past tense when speaking about results you achieved while in that role (e.g., “Generated 30% more revenue over 2015").

When explaining a professional role, you may use sentences or bullet points to highlight specific results you achieved while in the position. You do not need to use periods when using bullet points because they should not be complete sentences (e.g., “Achieved 27% year-over-year return on investments).

_Note: It’s always a good idea to quantify your achievements whenever possible!_

Make sure you’re using the correct capitalization with languages you mention (Java, Objective C, Ruby on Rails, Heroku, JavaScript, Sass, etc.), and make sure there is no redundant info in your Experience and Education sections.

## Contact Info

You should ALWAYS have your email, phone number, GitHub, and portfolio links at the very top of the résumé. There’s no need to include your street address, but be sure to include the city or region in which you are residing or willing to be employed. Some employers may be looking for employees within their specific area (although this has become less the case due to remote-first work) so keep your target audience in mind.

## About

If you have a non-programming background - it’s important to have a short “About” section. It should explain who you are as a developer and introduce the audience to the rest of your résumé.
1-3 lines explaining who you are as a developer, or something as brief & attention-grabbing as: “professional poker player with a thirst for problem-solving turned developer”. Another example is: “As a [previous position], I discovered that I really enjoy problem-solving, and now that I’ve learned Ruby, I’m ready to find solutions to the world’s problems with tech.” Or if your passion lies more in being organized and bringing structure to chaos, focus on that! Let your personality come through.
If you’re looking for inspiration, try thinking about what you love most about code and seeing if you can connect that with something in your past.

## Skills

After an About section, you’ll want to list your technical skills.
Only put skills you feel comfortable talking about. Never put “intro” next to something or in parentheses. When in doubt, ask a team member or mentor.

## Relevant Experience

Here’s where you get to list your previous work experience. Use the header of “Relevant Experience” to give yourself more wiggle room to choose what you include, and then whittle away anything that might detract from your experience as a programmer. This section is also a great place to briefly talk about your development projects.
Also, think about what skills are transferable to your new career from your previous roles - like time management, problem-solving, and organization. Try to think about what a hiring manager at a software company would want to see (resourceful, committed, loves learning).
Once you’ve determined the items you want to include, make sure to make them dynamic. For example, instead of “Sponsored the student council and organized community service and student-life events,” start with the stronger verb of “Organized” and expand on any good-to-know challenges you accomplished.

## Education

List any schools you attended in this section with the name of the school, the degree you pursued (or received), and the dates attended. If you did not complete a degree, you can say something like: “Received 40 credit hours toward degree”. You should also list any courses relevant to the job you’re applying to (e.g., Intro to Computer Science).

## References

If an employer needs references, they’ll ask you for them. Until then, they’re unnecessary and they take up valuable space on your résumé. Another thing to remember here: references are often a tool in helping you land a job, but the goal of your résumé is to help you get an interview. Mentioning references in your résumé is similar to putting the cart before the horse.
