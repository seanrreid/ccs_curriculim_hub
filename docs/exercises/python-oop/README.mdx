## Working with an existing class

Given the following `Person` class:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, email, phone):
      self.name = name
      self.email = email
      self.phone = phone

    def greet(self, other_person):
      print('Hello %s, I am %s!' % (other_person.name, self.name))
```

Write code to:

- Instantiate an instance object of Person with name of 'Sonny', email of `sonny@hotmail.com`, and phone of '483-485-4948', store it in the variable `sonny`.
- Instantiate another person with the name of 'Jordan', email of `jordan@aol.com`, and phone of '495-586-3456', store it in the variable `jordan`.
- Have `sonny` greet `jordan` using the greet method.
- Have `jordan` greet `sonny` using the greet method.
- Write a print statement to print the contact info (email and phone) of Sonny.
- Write another print statement to print the contact info of Jordan.

### Add another method

Add a `print_contact_info` method to the `Person` class that will print out the contact info for a object instance of Person.

```python
sonny.print_contact_info()
```

Should generate this output:

```py
Sonny's email: sonny@hotmail.com
Sonny's phone number: 483-485-4948
```

### Add an instance variable (attribute)

Add a `friends` instance variable (attribute) to the `Person` class.

You will initialize it to an empty list within the constructor `__init__`.

Once you've done this you should be able to add a friend to a person using list's append method:

`jordan.friends.append(sonny)`
`sonny.friends.append(jordan)`

You should also be able to get the number of friends a person has by using the len function on his friends:

```py
len(jordan.friends)
```

Will return:

```py
1
```

### Add an `add_friend` method

The fact that a person's friends attribute is a list is an implementation detail of the `Person` class.

Occassionally you'll want to hide implementation details from the users of your object/class. Implement an `add_friend` method to `Person`, so that in order to add a friend you call this method:

`jordan.add_friend(sonny)`

instead of:

`jordan.friends.append(sonny)`

### Add a `num_friends` method

We also want to hide the implementation detail that there is a friends attribute containing a list of friends.

To do this, we'll implement a `num_friends` method which returns the number of friends for a person.

For example:

```python
jordan.num_friends()
1
```

### Count number of greetings

We want to count the number of times a person has greeted someone. To do this, we'll add another attribute, `greeting_count`, and initialize it to `0`. Then each time the greet method is called, we'll increment `greeting_count` by `1`.

The output will resemble the following:

```py
>>> sonny.greeting_count
0
>>> sonny.greet(jordan)
>>> sonny.greeting_count
1
>>> sonny.greet(jordan)
>>> sonny.greeting_count
2
```

### Working with `__str__`

You may notice that when you are working with a person object, it's representation in the Python shell is pretty cryptic and unhelpful:

```sh
>>> print(jordan)
<__main__.Person object at 0x106976410>
```

Adding the `__str__` method to the `Person` class and have it return a string. Whatever you return there will be used to "represent" your person object.

For example, say I want a `Person` to be represented like this:
Jordan `jordan@aol.com` 495-586-3456

I could implement __str__ like this:

```python
def __str__(self):
     return 'Person: {} {} {}'.format(self.name, self.email, self.phone)
```

Implement your own `__str__` method, and you can represent your person objects however you want. Incidentally, `__str__` is also used when you use convert your object to a string: i.e. `str(jordan)`.

---

### Bonus Challenge

Keep track of the number of unique people a person has greeted, and be able to report that number via a `num_unique_people_greeted method`:

```py
>>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted()
0
>>> sonny.greet(jordan)
>>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted()
1
>>> sonny.greet(jordan)
>>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted()
1
>>> sonny.greet(dee_ann)
>>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted()
2
```

        self.friends = []
        self.greeting_count = 0
        self.unique_greeted = []

    def greet(self, other_person):
        print('Hello {}, I am {}!'.format(other_person.name, self.name))
        self.greeting_count += 1
        self.unique_greeted.append(other_person.name)

        self.friends.append(friend.name)

    def num_of_friends(self):
        print(len(self.friends))

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Person: Name - {}, Email - {}, Phone - {}'.format(self.name, self.email, self.phone)

        uniques = set(self.unique_greeted)
        uniques_greeted = list(uniques)

## Cuddly Pet

Start with these classes:

```py
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, fullness=50, happiness=50, hunger=5, mopiness=5):
        self.name = name
        self.fullness = fullness
        self.happiness = happiness
        self.hunger = hunger
        self.mopiness = mopiness

    def eat_food(self):
        self.fullness += 30

    def get_love(self):
        self.happiness += 30

    def be_alive(self):
        self.fullness -= self.hunger
        self.happiness -= self.mopiness


class CuddlyPet(Pet):
    def __init__(self, name, fullness=50, hunger=5, cuddle_level=1):
        super().__init__(name, fullness, 100, hunger, 1)
        self.cuddle_level = cuddle_level

    def be_alive(self):
        self.fullness -= self.hunger
        self.happiness -= self.mopiness/2

    def cuddle(self, other_pet):
        # Super cuddle powers, activate!
        for i in range(self.cuddle_level):
            other_pet.get_love()
```

### Level 1

1. Overriding `__str__()` in `CuddlyPet`

    When you pass a `CuddlyPet` instance to the `print()` function, it uses the `Pet` version of the method.

    Override the definition of `__str__()` in `CuddlyPet` so that the return value includes the string `"Extra cuddly"`.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

    You can add a `def __str__(self)` to `CuddlyPet` that will override the `Pet` version of `__str__()`.

    This will give `CuddlyPet` a custom version,

    ```py
    class CuddlyPet(Pet):
        def __init__(self, name, fullness=50, hunger=5, cuddle_level=1):
            super().__init__(name, fullness, 100, hunger, 1)
            self.cuddle_level = cuddle_level

        def be_alive(self):
            self.fullness -= self.hunger
            self.happiness -= self.mopiness/2

        def cuddle(self, other_pet):
            # Super cuddle powers, activate!
            for i in range(self.cuddle_level):
                other_pet.get_love()

        def __str__(self):
            return """
                Extra Cuddly %s:
                Fullness: %d
                Happiness: %d
                """ % (self.name, self.fullness, self.happiness)
    ```
</details>

2. Using `super()` in `CuddlyPet.be_alive()`

    `CuddlyPet` has a custom version of `be_alive()`, but it's nearly identical to the definition in `Pet`.  The only difference is that we subtract `self.mopiness/2` from `self.happiness` for a `CuddlyPet`.

    If our Virtual Pets get more complex, we might add more lines to `be_alive()`. It would be tedious to update both versions of `be_alive()`.

    One solution is for `CuddlyPet` to call `Pet.be_alive()` and then increase its `self.happiness`.  Modify `CuddlyPet.be_alive()` so that it calls `super()` to invoke `Pet`'s version of `be_alive()`.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    ```py
    class CuddlyPet(Pet):
        def __init__(self, name, fullness=50, hunger=5, cuddle_level=1):
            super().__init__(name, fullness, 100, hunger, 1)
            self.cuddle_level = cuddle_level

        def be_alive(self):
            super().be_alive()
            self.happiness += self.mopiness/2
    ```
</details>

### Level 2

1. Add a `Treat` class to your `Pet` simulator.

    When you give one of your `Pet` objects a treat, prompt the user to choose one of three kinds:

    * `ColdPizza`
    * `Bacon`
    * `VeganSnack`

    Create a class for each of these, and customize them so that they have differing effects on the `Pet` object's `fullness` and `happiness` levels.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

    First, create a `treat.py` file with a `Treat` class. Give it a constructor that accepts arguments for setting the `yum` and `joy` attributes:

    ```py
    class Treat:
        def __init__(self, yum=10, joy=10):
            self.yum = yum
            self.joy = joy
    ```

    Create three subclasses of `Treat`, each passing in custom values for `yum` and `joy` using `super().__init()`:

    ```py
    class ColdPizza(Treat):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(15, 20)

    class Bacon(Treat):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(30, 30)

    class VeganSnack(Treat):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__(2, 1)
    ```

    Modify your `Pet` class so that it knows how to `eat_treat()`:

    ```py
    class Pet:
        def eat_treat(self, treat):
            self.fullness += treat.yum
            self.happiness += treat.joy
    ```

    Finally, modify your main program, adding imports and menu options for giving treats to your pets:

    ```py
    from pet import Pet, CuddlyPet
    from toy import Toy
    ```

    Import your treats

    ```py
    from treat import ColdPizza, Bacon, VeganSnack

    # Add a variable for the `treat_menu`
    adoption_menu = [
        "Pet",
        "Cuddly Pet"
    ]

    treat_menu = [
        "ColdPizza",
        "Bacon",
        "VeganSnack"
    ]
    ```

    Add to the main menu:

    ```py
            if choice == 6:
                # Pet levels naturally lower.
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.be_alive()
            if choice == 7:
                print("Please choose what type of treat:")
                treat_choice = get_user_choice(treat_menu)
                if treat_choice == 1:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(ColdPizza())
                if treat_choice == 2:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(Bacon())
                if treat_choice == 3:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(VeganSnack())
    ```
</details>

2. Create a `Menu` class for your `Pet` simulator

    Create a `Menu` class that has the following attributes:

    - `prompt_text` - the text to show the user

    Add the following methods to the `Menu` class

    - `get_choice()` - shows the user the `prompt_text` and converts their input to an `int`, prompting again if they enter an invalid value.

    Modify the `while` loop of your `Pet` simulator so that it uses a `Menu` instance to handle user interaction.

    For each additional prompt (such as choosing which kind of `Pet` subclass to adopt), use additional `Menu` instances.

<details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

    Start by creating a `menu.py` file with a `Menu` class. Define the `__init__()` so that it accepts `prompt_text` as an argument. Define `get_choice()` but leave it blank for now.

    ```py
    class Menu:
        def __init__(self, prompt_text):
            self.prompt_text = prompt_text

        def get_choice(self):
            pass
    ```

    The functions you called inside of your `while` loop can be moved to this class. They will need to be modified so that they accept the `self` argument. They also need to be modified to call each other using the `self.` prefix.

    In addition, the `choices_to_string()` method should use `self.prompt_text` instead of the hard-coded `"Please choose an option: "`

    ```py
    class Menu:
        def __init__(self, prompt_text):
            self.prompt_text = prompt_text

        def get_choice(self):
            pass

        def print_menu_error(self):
            print("That was not a valid choice. Try again.\n\n\n")

        def choices_to_string(self, choice_list):
            choice_string = ""
            num = 1
            for choice in choice_list:
                choice_string += "%d: %s\n" % (num, choice)
                num += 1
            choice_string += self.prompt_text
            return choice_string

        def get_user_choice(self, choice_list):
            choice = -1
            choice_string = self.choices_to_string(choice_list)
            while choice == -1:
                try:
                    choice = int(input(choice_string))
                    if choice <= 0 or choice > len(choice_list):
                        raise ValueError
                except ValueError:
                    self.print_menu_error()
            return choice
    ```

    Update `get_choice()` so that it:

    1. accepts a `choice_list`
    2. calls `self.get_user_choice()` and passes it `choice_list`

    ```py
    def get_choice(self, choice_list):
        return self.get_user_choice(choice_list)
    ```

    Modify your main program so that it uses your new `Menu` class.

    ```py
    from pet import Pet, CuddlyPet
    from toy import Toy
    from treat import ColdPizza, Bacon, VeganSnack
    from menu import Menu

    def main():
        app = Menu("Please choose an option: ")
        types = Menu("Please choose the type of pet: ")
        treats = Menu("Please choose a treat: ")

        while True:
            choice = app.get_choice(main_menu)
            if choice == 1:
                pet_name = input("What would you like to name your pet? ")
                type_choice = types.get_choice(adoption_menu)
                if type_choice == 1:
                    pets.append(Pet(pet_name))
                else:
                    pets.append(CuddlyPet(pet_name))
                print("You now have %d pets" % len(pets))
            if choice == 2:
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.get_love()
            if choice == 3:
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.eat_food()
            if choice == 4:
                for pet in pets:
                    print(pet)
            if choice == 5:
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.get_toy(Toy())
            if choice == 6:
                # Pet levels naturally lower.
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.be_alive()
            if choice == 7:
                treat_choice = treats.get_choice(treat_menu)
                if treat_choice == 1:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(ColdPizza())
                if treat_choice == 2:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(Bacon())
                if treat_choice == 3:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(VeganSnack())
    ```
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Alternate Solution</summary>

    Bonus: the code could be improved further. Instead of passing the `choice_list` to `get_choice()`, it could be passed into the constructor:

    ```py
    def __init__(self, prompt_text, choice_list):
        self.prompt_text = prompt_text
        self.choice_list = choice_list

    def get_choice(self):
        return self.get_user_choice(self.choice_list)
    ```

    Your `main()` function changes to:

    ```py
    def main():
        app = Menu("Please choose an option: ", main_menu)
        types = Menu("Please choose the type of pet: ", adoption_menu)
        treats = Menu("Please choose a treat: ", treat_menu)

        while True:
            choice = app.get_choice()
            if choice == 1:
                pet_name = input("What would you like to name your pet? ")
                type_choice = types.get_choice()
                if type_choice == 1:
                    pets.append(Pet(pet_name))
                else:
                    pets.append(CuddlyPet(pet_name))
                print("You now have %d pets" % len(pets))
            if choice == 2:
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.get_love()
            if choice == 3:
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.eat_food()
            if choice == 4:
                for pet in pets:
                    print(pet)
            if choice == 5:
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.get_toy(Toy())
            if choice == 6:
                # Pet levels naturally lower.
                for pet in pets:
                    pet.be_alive()
            if choice == 7:
                treat_choice = treats.get_choice()
                if treat_choice == 1:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(ColdPizza())
                if treat_choice == 2:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(Bacon())
                if treat_choice == 3:
                    for pet in pets:
                        pet.eat_treat(VeganSnack())
    ```

## Garden Simulator - Level 9000

Create the following classes to simulate a garden:

    - `Tree` - its shade decreases water loss by `2`
    - `Gnome` - each instance adds a `5%` chance of rain
    - `Woodchuck` - creates a `5%` chance of a `Tree` disappearing
    - `Garden` - has separate lists for instances of `Tree`, `Gnome`, and `Woodchuck`

Create a main `while` loop that runs your simulator. During each turn, your `Garden` may experience rain, or may have a `Woodchuck` move in. For each of its lists, tally up the various percents that an event will occur and use the built-in `random` module to decide what happens during that turn. (See [https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html) for more information)

Every 10th turn, you have a random chance of earning another `Tree` or `Gnome`.

The simulation ends if you reach `10` `Tree` instances.
